For years, fluctuations in global climate patterns has been influenced by
atmospheric teleconnection patterns. These atmospheric teleconnections are related to
one another at large geographical distances. Although climate variabilities have been
confirmed to be related to atmospheric teleconnections, what still remains to be
discovered is the causal relationships between atmospheric variables.
Thus, this study seeks to discover the causal relationships between these
variables and how they can be used to identify teleconnection patterns. For this study,
the Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) based approach was applied, where each node
represents a variable and location while their arcs represents a relationship. Using this
probabilistic graphical model focused on dynamic systems allows for making inferences
on the causal relationships between variables.
To begin, data retrieved from ERA-Interim global atmospheric reanalysis data set
between 1979 and 2018 was used and recomposed within an empirical orthogonal
function (EOF). To discover the DBN, a time lag of a fixed amount was imposed on
each variable. Then, the K2 algorithm was implemented for score-based structure
learning on the lagged data set. Next, the structure was used to estimate the
parameters of the learned model which can be used to make inferences.
After running the data through the K2 algorithm and scoring the connections with
the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) scoring function, it was concluded, from the
structure of the network, that there exist several causal connections between variables
at different locations with varying time lags. What remains to be studied is comparing
this causal approach to other graphical models and their techniques to rate their
accuracy and efficiency between one another. The findings present causal relationships
between atmospheric variables which domain experts can utilize to make general
predictions on teleconnection patterns.
