# Climate-Data-UMBC-Summer-Research
COEIT Summer Research Program @UMBC. Contains Data and Jupyter Notebooks for implementing Dynamic Bayesian Networks to determine the causal relationships between atmospheric teleconnections


For years, fluctuations in global climate patterns has been influenced by atmospheric teleconnection patterns. These atmospheric teleconnections are related to one another at large geographical distances. Although climate variabilities have been confirmed to be related to atmospheric teleconnections, what still remains to be discovered is the causal relationships between atmospheric variables. For this project, a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) was created to identify these causal relationships. Using this probabilistic graphical model focused on dynamic systems allows for making inferences on the relationships between atmospheric variables and further understanding of their teleconnections.
